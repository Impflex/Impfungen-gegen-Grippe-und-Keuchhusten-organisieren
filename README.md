## 🤯 Problem Statement
> What exact problem are we trying to solve?

The World Health Organization and the Robert Koch Institute
recommend vaccinations against influenza and pertussis (influenza and pneumococcus) to risk groups. The problem is to organise these (with the aim of having as few people as possible in contact with them). In particular, it seems inefficient if each individual person at risk visits a doctor, gets informed about the vaccination, orders vaccine and comes back for vaccination later.

## 🚀 Solution
> How are we trying to solve this problem?

There are different solutions that we try to solve in a web app.
Ideas:  
- Appointment for vaccination online (similar to the appointment with TÜV)
- Information page online cooperation
- Portal for vaccine manufacturers, health insurance companies, medical assistants
